1️⃣ User Flow
🔹 User speaks → Voice is captured via the microphone.
🔹 Speech-to-Text (STT) → Converts speech into text.
🔹 Send text to ChatGPT API → AI processes and generates a response.
🔹 Text-to-Speech (TTS) → Converts AI response back to speech.
🔹 AI speaks back → Response is played to the user.

🖥️ Tech Stack
✅ Frontend: React (for UI & interactions)
✅ Backend: Node.js + Express (to handle API requests)
✅ Speech-to-Text (STT): Web Speech API / Whisper / Google STT
✅ ChatGPT API: OpenAI GPT-4 API
✅ Text-to-Speech (TTS): Web Speech API / Google TTS / ElevenLabs
✅ Database (Optional): MongoDB (to store conversation history, user progress)
```

🛠️ Detailed Component Breakdown
📌 1. Frontend (React)
✅ Capture microphone input.
✅ Use Web Speech API (or Whisper API) for Speech-to-Text.
✅ Send the text to the backend via API.
✅ Receive the AI-generated response from the backend.
✅ Use Web Speech API (or Google TTS) to convert text to speech.
✅ Play the audio for the user.

📌 2. Backend (Node.js + Express)
✅ Receives text from the frontend.
✅ Calls OpenAI’s ChatGPT API to get an AI-generated response.
✅ Sends the response back to the frontend.

📌 Bonus:

   * Store conversation history in MongoDB (optional).

  * Implement grammar feedback based on AI analysis.


  📌 3. API Integrations
🔹 Speech-to-Text (STT): Converts speech to text

* Options: Web Speech API (browser-based), Whisper API (more accurate)
🔹 ChatGPT API: Processes and generates responses

* Endpoint: OpenAI API (GPT-4)
🔹 Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts AI response to voice

* Options: Web Speech API, Google TTS, ElevenLabs


💡 Next Steps
1️⃣ Set up React frontend (Microphone input, display text, play audio).
2️⃣ Create Node.js backend (API routes for processing voice & AI response).
3️⃣ Integrate STT & TTS APIs (Convert voice to text & AI response to speech).
4️⃣ Test API calls (Send/receive data with OpenAI API).
5️⃣ Deploy (Netlify for frontend, Render/Vercel for backend).
